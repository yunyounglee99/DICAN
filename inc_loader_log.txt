[*] Testing Incremental Loader with DATA_ROOT: /root/DICAN_DATASETS

============================================================
Start Checking Session 1: APTOS 2019
============================================================
[TRAIN] Session 1: Few-shot applied -> 25 samples.
  [Train] Loader created.
    -> Dataset size: 25 images
    -> Expected size: <= 25 (5 classes * 5 shot)
    -> Batch Fetch Success!
    -> Image Shape: torch.Size([4, 3, 224, 224]) (Batch, C, H, W)
    -> Label Shape: torch.Size([4])
    -> Sample Labels: [0, 4, 3, 0]
    -> [PASS] Few-shot sampling seems correct.

  [Val] Loader created (Split Check).
    -> Dataset size: 366 images
    -> [PASS] Validation set is larger than Few-shot Train set.

  [SUCCESS] Session 1 (APTOS 2019) is ready for training!



============================================================
Start Checking Session 2: Messidor-2
============================================================
  [Messidor-2] Dropped 4 rows with missing labels.
[TRAIN] Session 2: Few-shot applied -> 25 samples.
  [Train] Loader created.
    -> Dataset size: 25 images

    -> Batch Fetch Success!
    -> Image Shape: torch.Size([4, 3, 224, 224]) (Batch, C, H, W)
    -> Label Shape: torch.Size([4])
    -> Sample Labels: [3, 0, 2, 0]
    -> [PASS] Few-shot sampling seems correct.
  [Messidor-2] Dropped 4 rows with missing labels.

  [Val] Loader created (Split Check).
    -> Dataset size: 174 images
    -> [PASS] Validation set is larger than Few-shot Train set.

  [SUCCESS] Session 2 (Messidor-2) is ready for training!



============================================================
